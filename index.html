            <p class="para2">A "sweet cake" generally refers to a baked dessert, typically sweet, made with flour,
                sugar, eggs, and other ingredients, and often decorated with frosting, icing, or other toppings. Cakes
                come in a wide variety, from simple, everyday treats to elaborate, celebratory creations.

            <p class="para3">Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from cream skimmed
                from whey, a
                by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy, and
                "cheesy". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold as: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so
                on.</p>

            <p>To bake a sweet cake, start by preparing your pan and preheating the oven. Then, cream together butter
                and sugar, add eggs one at a time, and gradually incorporate dry and wet ingredients. Bake until a
                toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake completely before frosting.Cake is a
                form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients,
                that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread,
                but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
                elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries,
                meringues, custards, and pies. The most commonly used cake ingredients
                include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening
                agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients
                and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts
                such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
                Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like
                pastry cream), iced with butter cream or other icings, and decorated with
                marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
                Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as
                weddings, an
                niversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes;
                some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.
                Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time
                considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg
                foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even
                the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.
